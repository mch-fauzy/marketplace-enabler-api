## Guidelines
Before we look into how, here are the guidelines. If your Pull Requests fail
to pass these guidelines it will be declined and you will need to re-submit
when youâ€™ve made the changes. This might sound a bit tough, but it is required
for us to maintain quality of the code-base.

## Code Style
All code must meet the Style Guide, SnakeCase, CamelCase or any underscores and readable operators. This makes certain 
that all code is the same format as the existing code and means it will be as readable as possible.

## Documentation
If you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will need to add it. New packages, methods, 
parameters, changing default values, etc are all things that will require a change to documentation. 
The change-log must also be updated for every change.

## Compatibility
Code should maintain compatibility with the latest version of the code-base.

## Branching
Choose how you want as branching model 

_for example :_ 
"Git Flow" requires all pull requests to be sent to the "develop" branch. This is
where the next planned version will be developed. The "master" branch will always contain the latest stable version and 
is kept clean so a "hotfix" (e.g: an emergency security patch) can be applied to master to create a new version, without 
worrying about other features holding it up. For this reason all commits need to be made to "develop" and any sent to "master" 
will be closed automatically. If you have multiple changes to submit, please place all changes into their own branch on your fork.
One thing at a time: A pull request should only contain one change. That does not mean only one commit, 
but one change - however many commits it took. The reason for this is that if you change X and Y but send a pull 
request for both at the same time, we might really want X but disagree with Y, meaning we cannot merge the request. 
Using the Git-Flow branching model you can create new branches for both of these features and send two requests.

## Keeping your personal branch or fork up-to-date
Always keep your branch or fork up-to-date with the latest stable version of the code-base before doing pull requests.
